# TCP server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a TCP server with CYW955913EVK-01. In this example, the TCP server establishes a connection with a TCP client. After the successful connection, the server allows the user to send LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client and the client responds by sending an acknowledgement message to the server. Additionally, this code example can be configured to bring up the Wi-Fi device either in STA interface or Soft AP interface mode.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[TcpServer](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-threadx-wifi-tcp-server)" application with the desired name "TcpServer" configured for the *CYW955913EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955913EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-threadx-wifi-tcp-server --user-app-name TcpServer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

<mark>Update the above paragraph and commands to match your CE.

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. The kit can be configured to run either in the Wi-Fi STA or AP interface modes. Configure the interface mode using the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro defined in the *tcp_server.c* file. Based on the desired interface mode, do the following:

   **Kit in STA mode (default interface):**

   1. Set the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro to '0'; default mode.

   2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the Wi-Fi network credentials that you want to connect to in the *tcp_server.c* file. Ensure to configure your connecting Wi-Fi network as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

   **Kit in AP mode:**

   1. Set the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro to '1'.

   2. (Optional) Update the `SOFTAP_SSID`, `SOFTAP_PASSWORD`, and `SOFTAP_SECURITY_TYPE` as desired.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program using one of the following and reset the board:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=APP_<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=APP_CYW955913EVK-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

   ![](images/tcp-server-sta-pre-connection.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 2. Wi-Fi interface in AP mode**

   ![](images/tcp-server-ap-pre-connection.png)


5. Connect your PC to the Wi-Fi AP that you have configured in **Step 2**.

   - In STA mode: Connect the PC to the same AP to which the kit is connected.

   - In AP mode: Connect the PC to the kit's AP.

   Note the IP address assigned to the kit as shown in **Figure 1** (for STA mode) and **Figure 2** (for AP mode).

6. Open the *tcp_client.py* script located in the  *{project directory}* in a text editor and update the IP address with the IP address assigned to your kit (as noted in **Step 5**).

    For example, if the IP address assigned to your kit is `192.168.10.1`, update the following line in the *tcp_client.py* script:

    ```
    DEFAULT_IP   = '192.168.10.1'
    ```

7. From the project directory, open a command shell and run the Python TCP client (*tcp_client.py*). In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

    ```
      python tcp_client.py
    ```

   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your PC allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the TCP server. For more details on enabling Python access, see the [community thread](https://community.infineon.com/thread/53662).


8. Press the user button (CYBSP_USER_BTN) to send LED ON/OFF command to the Python TCP client. Each user button press will issue the LED ON/OFF commands alternately. The client, in turn, sends an acknowledgement message back to the server. **Figure 3** and **Figure 4** show the TCP server in STA and AP modes respectively. **Figure 5** shows the corresponding TCP client output.

   **Note:**   LED is not turned ON/OFF on the board , when sending the LED ON/OFF command to the TCP client .

   ![](images/tcp-server-ap-post-connection.png)

   <br />

   **Figure 5. TCP client output**

   ![](images/tcp-client-output.png)

   **Note:** Instead of using the Python TCP client (*tcp_client.py*), you can use the example [mtb-example-threadx-wifi-tcp-client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-tcp-client) to run as the TCP client on a second kit. See the code example documentation.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Attach (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).
